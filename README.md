# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course - Making an AI model to analyse information presented by corporate borrowers to minimise fraud and other risks

## Summary

This project aims to create an AI model using financial statements and other information of a large number of corporate borrowers and their historical credit losses. This model can be put to use by credit teams at lenders to analyse financial statements and other information of future potential corporate borrowers and to help credit teams identify red flags in advance. Eventually, this model can help bring down credit losses.

## Background

Problem 1 - Identification of red flags in potential borrowers
Problem 2 - Reduce over reliance on subjective opinion of credit teams

Having been a lender in the past, I am aware of the criticality of careful credit assessments and the requirement to minimise credit losses. This project can be a big aid to lenders in reducing credit costs by either staying away from transactions or by building in suitable mitigants.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

The solution can be used by any lender to process lare amount of information collated about each borrower, and even for a large number of borrowers, to identify red flags based on which decision makers can either make a yes/ no call or stipulate suitable mitigants to reduce the risks of a transaction.

The solution can be used prior to a transaction, or subsequently over the timeframe of the transaction.

Users will typically be credit decision makers at lending institutions, both approvers as well as portfolio managers.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?

Data can come from (1) public sources for listed companies and news items in public domain as well as (2) from lending institutions who can share anonymysed data on the basis that it can help prepare a model which can be of use to them in future.

## Challenges

This model may present a risk score which can be used as one of the inputs, not the sole input, for decision making. The challenge can come from varying amount of disclosures made by various borrowers. 

## What next?

This project will require collaboration with (1) lenders for adequate data points and (2) coders to implement the model 


## Acknowledgments

The inspiration comes from my experiences at multiple lenders over the past 25 years.
